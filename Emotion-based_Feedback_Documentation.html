                <p1>&emsp; Our collective acknowledgment of the importance of having a tool that gives real and accurate
                    feedback led us in the decision for the creation of this application. The main goal is to bring
                    closer together the people who need feedback and the people willing to provide it. It also reduces
                    the time spend reading all the reviews, by interpreting the selected emotions beforehand, easing the
                    provider's process of creating a bigger picture of the customer's emotions and opinions regarding
                    the displayed product or service.

                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our initiative is to bring together any type of provider to their clients. By doing so, the time
                    spent by the providers of goods is be exponentially reduced and they have have a clearer picture of
                    their customers' opinions on their service. It is useful especially for people that want to launch a
                    new product and that do not have the resources to analyse the market on their own before taking the
                    big step. Our goal is also to create a safe space accessible to anyone that wants to share their
                    experience and emotions on a product, or service.

            <h2> &ensp; Overall Description</h2>

            <section id="ProductPerspective" typeof="sa:ProductPerspective">
                <h3>&emsp; Product Perspective</h3>
                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our product checks both the functional and quality requirements for products of its kind, so we will
                    go deeper into some of its most important characteristics, which will be detailed in the sections
                    below. <br>
                    &emsp; The functional requirements that define its behaviour are the possibility of creating an
                    account if not existent, leaving room for users that are not logged to use the application in a
                    similar manner to reviewers. However, the functionality that describes uploading products as forms
                    that expire, as well as the interpreted results is only available to the users that already have an
                    account.<br>
                    &emsp;The application also fits quality requirements, as it is precise in generating information,
                    highly throughput and exceedingly safe for both registered users and guests, in terms of
                    confidentiality and data management.<br>
                    &emsp; The problem which we identified is the well known need of business owners and management
                    teams, as well as artists and regular people to centralise and analyse information about their
                    specific product or provided service. These features shift the product perspective as a powerful
                    tool that can significantly reduce, or even fully dismiss the time spent researching. As users leave
                    anonymous reviews, the level of honesty is increased and the application’s analysis of the reviews
                    are be indubitably accurate.<br>
                    The evaluated emotions are selected from the Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions, shown below. Each "petal"
                    represents an emotion, while the closer to the center the emotion is, the more intense the emotion
                    is felt.

            <section id="ProductFunctions" typeof="sa:ProductFunctions">
                <h3>&emsp; Product Functions</h3>
                <p1>We will split the functionalities into more subcategories, as follows:

                    <section id="LoggedUsersFunctions" typeof="sa:LoggedUsersFunctions">
                        <h4>&nbsp;Logged Users Functions <h4>
                                <p1>
                                    Creating an account.<br>
                                </p1>
                                <p2> 2. Uploading a form as a “post” and request reviews from any category of people
                                    that are willing to help, or are interested in giving their review, in case they
                                    personally benefited from its usage, or from the provided service, such as events,
                                    firms, sole proprietorships and any other kind of service providers.<br>
                                </p2> 3. Set an expiration date for the uploaded form and wait for the reviews to pile
                                up. Once the expiration date has passed, a graphical analysis of the messages is
                                provided by the application, that consists of elegantly structured data, that sums up
                                the emotions that people felt while writing the message. The form uploaders are also
                                able to see the emotions inserted by the reviewers for each aspect they chose.<br>
                                <p3> 4. See personalised suggestions on products they might also want to review.<br>

                                        stored, which makes the process fully anonymous. For users that have an account,
                                        however, the message is linked to their information.The information is not
                                        publicly accessible, as it is only used by the application in order to better
                                        detect the patterns of behaviour each client has and provide a better analysis
                                        of the feedback for the product uploaders.<br>
                                    </p1>

                <h3>&emsp; User Interfaces</h3>
                <p1>&emsp;The graphical UI consists of multiple windows.The application opens up on the Homepage, for
                    both classes of users. The only difference in UX design between the logged and unlogged users lays
                    in the headers and footers.<br>

                    &emsp;Below, the unlogged users header is shown.
                    <br><br>
                    <center>
                        <img src="Design/UnloggedHeader.png" alt="Facultatea de Informatică Iași" width="700">

                    </center>
                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;The logged users header has less buttons, as shown in the next picture.
                    <br><br>
                    <center>
                        <img src="Design/LoggedHeader.png" alt="Facultatea de Informatică Iași" width="700">
                    </center>
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;The unlogged footer has the following structure for unlogged users.

                    <br><br>
                    <center>
                        <img src="Design/UnloggedFooter.png" alt="Facultatea de Informatică Iași" width="700">
                    </center>
                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;Users who posses an account, however, will have less information and functionalities on
                    the footer.

                    <br><br>
                    <center>
                        <img src="Design/LoggedFooter.png" alt="Facultatea de Informatică Iași" width="700">

                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;On the Homepage, users can see the “product of
                    the week”, meaning the most reviewed product. Beneath, the “Add a product” feature is
                    implemented, however, it will redirect the unlogged users to the “Sign In” page. Following up
                    are the “Recently Added” and “Most Reviewed”, as a top following the “Product Of The Week”. By
                    clicking on any of the “Send feedback” buttons, the unlogged user is able to add an anonymous
                    review.<br>
                    &emsp;The header of the Homepage consists of three buttons with different functionalities. The
                    “Sign Un” and “Log In” buttons will open up the “Sign In”, respectively the “Log In” pages,
                    while the “Search By Category” button will open up a pop-up menu, where all types of users will
                    be able to filter and find the category of products that they prefer to review.<br>
                    Below is the full example.
                    <br><br>
                    <center>

                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;The logged users have the same features, however, the "Add A Product" redirects the user to
                    the "Add Product" page, which will be presented later.<br> The "Recent" section shows the products
                    which the user last reviewed, while the "For You" presents the products recommended to review, based
                    on the main and subcategory the user most reviewed on, as well as the trending and most reviewed
                    products in the frequented categories, overall.

                    The reviewed characteristics of the product are selected by category, then a specific intensity

                    <br><br>
                    Once logged, the user can upload a product, by setting a name, a description and a representative
                    picture. Each category has default characteristics to be reviewed, which will be compared, when the
                    form is closed, between the products belonging to the same category. Each uploader will decide which
                    characteristics seem fit and which characteristics they want to compare with other products'. They
                    also can also write some specific characteristics they want users to review.<br> Each form with a
                    product is being kept available to users for a period of time selected by the uploader, at the time
                    of uploading. The form submission process can be seen below.

                    personal data and profile description can be updated at any time. This data will be used
                    anonymously, in order to create detailed statistics.<br>
                    A special section for the products that the user has already reviewed is also accesible from this
                    page.

                    passed the closing date.<br>
                    The ongoing forms can be closed, or deleted, while on the other hand, for the closed forms,
                    the uploader is able to see an interpreted result of the emotions felt, which is downloadable in
                    many formats, such as HTML, CSV and JSON, as well as with more user-friendly data representation, in
                    a PDF format.

                    Each contains a subcategory, such that searching for the desired product can be done with ease,
                    and the interpretation can be done with as many common characteristics as possible.
