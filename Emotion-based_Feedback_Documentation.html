                    accurate
                    feedback
                    led
                    us in the decision for the creation of this application.
                    The main goal is to bring closer together the people who need feedback, and the people willing to
                    provide
                    it.
                    It also reduces the time spend reading all the reviews, by interpreting the messages beforehand,
                    easing
                    the
                    provider's process of having a bigger picture of the customer's emotions and opinions regarding the
                    displayed product or service.

                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our initiative is to bring together any type of provider to their clients. By doing so, the time
                    spent
                    by the providers of goods is be exponentially reduced and they have have a clearer picture of
                    their
                    customers' opinions on their service. It is useful especially for people that want to launch a new
                    product and that do not have the resources to analyse the market on their own before taking the big
                    step. Our goal is also to create a safe space accessible to anyone that wants to share their
                    experience
                    or thoughts on a product, or service.

            <section id="ProductPerspective" typeof="sa:ProductPerspective">
                <h3>&emsp; Product Perspective</h3>
                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our product checks both the functional and quality requirements for products of its kind, so we will
                    go deeper into some of its most important characteristics, which will be detailed in the sections
                    below. <br>
                    &emsp; The functional requirements that define its behaviour are the possibility of creating an
                    account if
                    not existent, leaving room for users that are not logged to use the application in a similar manner
                    to reviewers. However, the functionality that describes uploading products as forms that expire, as
                    well as the interpreted results is only available to the users that already have an
                    account.<br>
                    The application also fits quality requirements, as it is precise in generating information, highly
                    throughput and exceedingly safe for both registered users and guests, in terms of confidentiality
                    while using the app and data management.
                    <br>
                    &emsp; The problem which we identified is the well known need of business owners and management
                    teams, as
                    well as artists and regular people to centralise and analyse information about their specific
                    product or provided service. These features shift the product perspective as a powerful tool that
                    can significantly reduce, or even fully cover the time spent researching. As users leave
                    anonymous reviews, the level of honesty is increased and the application’s analysis of the reviews
                    are be indubitably accurate.

            <section id="ProductFunctions" typeof="sa:ProductFunctions">
                <h3>&emsp; Product Functions</h3>
                <p1>We will split the functionalities into more main categories, as follows:

                    <section id="LoggedUsersFunctions" typeof="sa:LoggedUsersFunctions">
                        <h4>&emsp;Logged Users Functions <h4>
                                <p1>
                                    Creating an account.<br>
                                </p1>
                                <p2> 2. Uploading a form as a “post” and request reviews from any category of people
                                    that
                                    are
                                    willing to
                                    help, or are interested in giving their review, in case they personally benefited
                                    from
                                    its usage, or
                                    from the provided service, such as events, firms, sole proprietorships and any other
                                    kind of service
                                    providers.<br>
                                </p2> 3. Set an expiration date for the uploaded form and wait for the reviews to pile
                                up.
                                Once the expiration date has passed, a graphical analysis of the messages is
                                provided by the
                                application, that consists of elegantly structured data, that sums up the
                                emotions that
                                people felt while writing the message. The form uploaders are also able to see the
                                detected emotion
                                of each comment.<br>

                    The indentified users from the practical point of view are people that present the difficulties
                    presented above.<br>

                    &emsp;Approaching from a more theoretical perspective, the identified users are split
                    into three main categories, as users without accounts, with limited access to the provided features,
                    and users with accounts that have different accessibility levels, depending on whether they uploaded
                    a product or service, or just reviewed other posts anonymously.<br>

                    &emsp;For a clearer view, the diagram below pictures the use-cases and the users, by their type.
                    Note that
                    any user can log in, so only the less-obvious relations are pictured.
