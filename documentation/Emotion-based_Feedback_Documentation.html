                <h3>&emsp; Purpose</h3>
                <p1>&emsp; Our collective acknowledgment of the importance of having a tool that gives real and accurate
                    feedback led us in the decision for the creation of this application. The main goal is to bring
                    closer together the people who need feedback and the people willing to provide it. We also want
                    to reduce the time spend reading all the reviews, by interpreting the selected emotions beforehand,
                    easing the product providers' process of creating a bigger picture of the customers' emotions and
                    opinions regarding the displayed product, service, location or even person.

                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our initiative is to bring together any type of provider and their clients. By doing so, the time
                    spent by the providers of goods is exponentially reduced and they have have a clearer picture of
                    their customers' opinions on their service. It is useful especially for people who want to launch a
                    new product and who do not have the resources to analyse the market on their own before taking the
                    big step. Our goal is also to create a safe place, accessible to anyone who wants to share their
                    experience and emotions on a product.

            <section id="ProductPerspective" typeof="sa:ProductPerspective">
                <h3>&emsp; Product Perspective</h3>
                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our application checks both the functional and quality requirements for products of its kind, so we
                    will
                    dig deeper into some of its most important characteristics, which will be detailed in the sections
                    below. <br>
                    &emsp; The functional requirements that define its behaviour are the possibility of creating an
                    account, if not existent, leaving room for users that are not logged to use the application in a
                    similar manner to logged reviewers. However, the functionality that describes uploading products as
                    forms
                    that expire, as well as the interpreted results, is only available to the users that already have an
                    account.<br>
                    &emsp;The application also fits quality requirements, as it is precise in generating information,
                    highly throughput and exceedingly safe for both registered users and guests, in terms of
                    confidentiality and data management.<br>
                    &emsp; The problem which we identified is the well known need of business owners and management
                    teams, as well as artists and regular people to centralise and analyse information about their
                    specific product or provided service. These features shift the product perspective as a powerful
                    tool that can significantly reduce, or even fully dismiss the time spent researching. As users leave
                    anonymous reviews, the level of honesty is increased and the application’s analysis of the reviews
                    are be indubitably accurate.<br>
                    The evaluated emotions are selected from the Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions, shown below. Each "petal"
                    represents an emotion, while the closer to the center the emotion is, the more intense the emotion
                    is felt.

                <p1>We will split the functionalities into more subcategories, as follows:

                                <p2> Uploading a form as a “post” and request reviews from any category of people
                                    that are willing to help, or are interested in giving their review, in case they
                                    personally benefited from its usage, or from the provided service, such as events,
                                    firms, sole proprietorships and any other kind of service providers.<br>
                                </p2> 2. Set an expiration date for the uploaded form and wait for the reviews to pile
                                up. Once the expiration date has passed, a graphical analysis of the messages is
                                provided by the application, that consists of elegantly structured data, that sums up
                                the emotions chosen by the reviewers when sending feedback on the characteristics
                                imposed
                                by the owner. The form uploaders are also

                                        however, the message is linked to their information. The data is not
                                        publicly accessible, as it is only used by the application in order to better
                                        detect the patterns of behaviour each client has, and provide a better analysis
                                        of the feedback, for the product uploaders.<br>

                    for a browser to be present, in order for the application to work properly.

                    in the headers, footers and the recommended sections of products.<br>

                    &emsp;Below, the unlogged users header is shown.

                    &emsp;The logged users header has different buttons, as shown in the next picture.

                    &emsp;Users who posses an account, however, will have the following information and functionalities
                    on
                    the footer.

                    &emsp;On the Homepage, users can see the “Product Of
                    The Week”, meaning the most reviewed product. Beneath, the “Add a product” feature is
                    implemented. However, it will redirect the unlogged users to the “Sign In” page. Following up
                    are the “Recently Added” and “Most Reviewed”, following the “Product Of The Week”. By
                    clicking on any of the “Send feedback” buttons, the unlogged user is able to add an anonymous
                    review.<br>
                    &emsp;The header of the Homepage consists of three buttons with different functionalities. The
                    “Sign Un” and “Log In” buttons will open up the “Sign In”, respectively the “Log In” pages,
                    while the “Search By Category” button will open up a pop-up menu, where all types of users will
                    be able to filter and find the category of products that they prefer to review.<br>
                    Below is the full example.

                    &emsp;The logged users have the same features, however, the "Add A Product" redirects the user to
                    the "Add Product" page, which will be presented later.<br> The "Recent" section shows the products
                    which the user last reviewed, while the "For You" presents the products recommended to review, based
                    on the category and subcategory the user mostly reviewed on, as well as the trending and most
                    reviewed
                    products in the frequented categories, overall.

                    Once logged, the user can upload a product, by setting a name, a description and a representative
                    picture. Each category has default characteristics to be reviewed, which will be compared, when the

            <h2>&emsp; Further Development Strategies</h2>
            The project can be further developed by creating a descriptive review of products, such that using NLP, the
            emotion that is felt can be interpreted directly from the fully written review. Other special faetures can
            be added aswell, such as seeing overall ratings for products, in order to create a top with the most liked
            or disliked products. A new type of account can be developed, for "investitors", who could see the top
            ratings presented above, in order to find products that are worth sponsoring, with more detailed information
            about the whole market. The admin feature will also be necessary givem the increasig number of account
            types.<br>
            Given the project's structure and implementation, the ground for improvement has been already prepared,
            therefore, the source can be further developed, not modified, straightforwardly.
