                <p1>&emsp; Our collective acknowledgment of the importance of having a tool that gives real and accurate
                    feedback led us in the decision for the creation of this application. The main goal is to bring
                    closer together the people who need feedback and the people willing to provide it. We also want
                    to reduce the time spend reading all the reviews, by interpreting the selected emotions beforehand,
                    easing the product providers' process of creating a bigger picture of the customers' emotions and
                    opinions regarding the displayed product, service, location or even person.

                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our initiative is to bring together any type of provider and their clients. By doing so, the time
                    spent by the providers of goods is exponentially reduced and they have a clearer picture of
                    their customers' opinions on their service. It is useful especially for people who want to launch a
                    new product and who do not have the resources to analyse the market on their own before taking the
                    big step. Our goal is also to create a safe place, accessible to anyone who wants to share their
                    experience and emotions on a product.

                <p1>&emsp;
                    Our application checks both the functional and quality requirements for products of its kind, so we
                    will dig deeper into some of its most important characteristics, which will be detailed in the
                    sections below. <br>
                    &emsp; The functional requirements that define its behaviour are the possibility of creating an
                    account, if not existent, leaving room for users that are not logged to use the application in a
                    similar manner to logged reviewers. However, the functionality that describes uploading products as
                    forms that expire, as well as the interpreted results, is only available to the users that already
                    have an account.<br>
                    &emsp;The application also fits quality requirements, as it is precise in generating information,
                    highly throughput and exceedingly safe for both registered users and guests, in terms of
                    confidentiality and data management.<br>
                    &emsp; The problem which we identified is the well known need of business owners and management
                    teams, as well as artists and regular people to centralise and analyse information about their
                    specific product or provided service. These features shift the product perspective as a powerful
                    tool that can significantly reduce, or even fully dismiss the time spent researching. As users leave
                    anonymous reviews, the level of honesty is increased and the application’s analysis of the reviews
                    are be indubitably accurate.<br>
                    &emsp;The evaluated emotions are selected from the Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions, shown below. Each
                    "petal" represents an emotion, while the closer to the center the emotion is, the more intense it is
                    felt.

                                <p2> Uploading a form as a “post” and request reviews from any category of people
                                    that are willing to help, or are interested in giving their review, in case they
                                    personally benefited from its usage, or from the provided service, such as events,
                                    firms, sole proprietorship's and any other kind of service providers.<br>

                                2. Set an expiration date for the uploaded form and wait for the reviews to pile
                                up. Once the expiration date has passed, a graphical analysis of the messages is
                                provided by the application, that consists of elegantly structured data, that sums up
                                the emotions chosen by the reviewers when sending feedback on the characteristics
                                imposed by the owner. The form uploaders are also able to see the emotions inserted by
                                the reviewers for each aspect they chose.<br>

                                        however, the message is linked to their information. The data is not
                                        publicly accessible, as it is only used by the application in order to better
                                        detect the patterns of behaviour each client has, and provide a better analysis
                                        of the feedback, for the product uploaders.<br>

                <p1>&emsp;The graphical UI consists of multiple windows. The application opens up on the Homepage, for
                    both classes of users. The only difference in UX design between the logged and unlogged users lays
                    in the headers, footers and the recommended sections of products.<br>

                    &emsp;Below, the unlogged users header is shown.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;The logged users header has different buttons, as shown in the next pictures.

                    </center>
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;The footer has the following structure for unlogged users.

                    <br><br>
                    <center>
                        <img src="Design/UnloggedFooter.png" alt="Unlogged Footer" width="700">
                    </center>
                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;Users who possess an account, however, will have the following information and functionalities
                    on
                    the footer.

                    <br><br>

                        <img src="Design/LoggedFooter.png" alt="Logged Footer" width="700">
                    </center>
                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;In order to go to the Homepage, users must press the
                    icon in the top left corner of all pages, as it does not matter if they are logged or not.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;On the Homepage, users can see the “Product Of
                    The Week”, meaning the most reviewed product. Beneath, the “Add a product” feature is
                    implemented. However, it will redirect the unlogged users to the “Sign In” page. Following up
                    are the “Recently Added” and “Most Reviewed”, following the “Product Of The Week”. By
                    clicking on any of the “Send feedback” buttons, the unlogged user is able to add an anonymous
                    review.<br>
                    &emsp;The header of the Homepage consists of three buttons with different functionalities. The
                    “Sign Up” and “Sign In” buttons will open up the “Sign Up”, respectively the “Sign In” pages,
                    while the “Search By Category” button will open up a pop-up menu, where all types of users will
                    be able to filter and find the category of products that they prefer to review.<br>
                    Below is the full example.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;The logged users have the same features, however, the "Add A Product" redirects the user to
                    the "Add Product" page, which will be presented later.<br>
                    &emsp;The "Recent" section shows the products which the user last reviewed, while the "For You"
                    presents the products recommended to review based on the category and subcategory the user mostly
                    reviewed on, as well as the trending and most reviewed products in the frequented categories,
                    overall.

                    &emsp;In order to sign up or log in, a new page will open up, as such.

                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;Both the users with an account and those without are able to review products uploaded by
                    others and their identity will not be known.<br>
                    &emsp;The reviewed characteristics of the product are selected by category, then a specific
                    intensity of the chosen emotion is picked, as seen in the example below.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>

                    &emsp;Then, the confirmation page will ensure the user that the data has been submitted with
                    success.
                    Once logged, the user can upload a product, by setting a name, a description and a representative
                    picture. Each category has default characteristics to be reviewed, which will be compared, when the
                    form is closed, between the products belonging to the same category. Each uploader will decide which
                    characteristics seem fit and which characteristics they want to compare with other products'. They
                    can also write some specific features they want users to review.<br>
                    &emsp;Each form with a product is being kept available to users for a period of time selected by the
                    uploader, at the time of uploading. The form submission process can be seen below.

                    anonymously, in order to create detailed statistics.<br>
                    &emsp; Users can also log out by pressing the "Log Out" button anytime. <br>
                    &emsp;A special section for the products that the user uploaded is also accesible from this

                    both the forms that are ongoing and the ones that
                    passed the closing date.<br>
                    &emsp;The ongoing forms can be closed, or deleted, while on the other hand, for the closed forms,
                    the uploader is able to see an interpreted result of the emotions felt, which is downloadable in
                    many formats, such as HTML, CSV and JSON, as well as with more user-friendly data
                    representation.<br>

                                single threaded, it is highly scalable.<br>
                                The requests differ from multi-threaded servers, as there is no process where the thread
                                is being picked up from the thread pool, and then each thread runs independently. This
                                implies that for each request, no data sharing between the threads is needed.
                                There will be seven main services that will interact with the database, the
                                <b>register</b>, <b>login</b>, <b>products</b>, <b>forms</b>, <b>user-info</b>,
                                <b>statistics</b>
                                , <b>database-monitoring</b>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p1>
                </h5>

                <h5><b>3.&nbsp;Communication</b><br><br>
                    <p1>&emsp;The communication between the services, frontend and the database will be done using Json
                        files mainly, as there will be information such as forms, account and product data, which will
                        be stored and passed with ease.<br>
                        Although the used server can also initiate the request given its nature, the request-response
                        format is used uni-directionaly for our project, as the interaction is conditioned by the forms
                        that are passed from the client.<br>
                        The connection will be ensured by pooling, which have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, although
                        new connections might be required. More on the connection and communication implementation <u><a
                                target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html">here</a></u>.<br>
                        The communication between the server and the services will be ensured by the following usage of
                        the HTTP methods.

            <h3>&emsp; Communication Interfaces</h3>

            &emsp; The application, and mostly the services, have the following communication requirements, in order to
            work
            properly:
            <ul>
                <li>Connection and constant communication with the non-relational database, in order to extract and
                    upload
                    data.
                </li>
                <li>Access to the network while running, as it requires a browser.</li>
                <li>Using HTTP, the server will send HTTP requests with JSON body to the services, while the services
                    will respond with static files, such as images, and JSON-formatted files, for any other kind of
                    information extracted from the database, with the methods: GET, PUT, POST, PATCH and DELETE. In
                    order to
                    support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, the Node.js HTTP API is very low-level.
                    This
                    means that the communication will be done with stream handling and message parsing only, with REST
                    constrains.<br>
                    The <b>Server</b> is running on PORT 3000, while the available services are: <b>register</b> (PORT
                    3001), <b>login</b> (PORT 3002),<b>products</b> (PORT 3003), <b>forms</b> (PORT 3004),
                    <b>statistics</b> (PORT 3005), <b>user-information</b> (PORT 3006), <b>database-monitoring</b> (PORT
                    3007).<br>
                </li>
            </ul>
            &emsp; The application is structured in one main component, the Server and seven other services that
            interact with the database. To ensure security, all interactions with the database are first
            verified with a token, created by the login service and sent from the Client, and if the user does
            not have the permission to access, then the request will be denied.<br>
            &emsp;Also, for security concerns, only generic errors will be displayed, as any error will be treated
            internally and no exceptions messages will be accessible to the Client.
            This assures that the services protect the database and the chances of a successfull attack from
            fake clients, or from malicious data input are significantly decreased.<br><br>
            &emsp;<b>Register</b> - will create the account and store the hashed-coded password and other user
            information in the database.<br>
            &emsp;<b>Login</b> - will create the token used by the user to log in their account. <br>
            &emsp;<b>Products</b> - will manage the extraction of information about the products, as well as insert
            new products.<br>
            &emsp;<b>Forms</b> - provides the information about the fields selected by the user, and inserts in the
            database the reviews.<br>
            &emsp;<b>Statistics</b> - will provide the data that is parsed and used in the Client, to create
            charts.<br>
            &emsp;<b>User-information</b> - extracts information about the user, for the "My Account" page, as well as
            updates information, in case the user wants to change it.<br>
            &emsp;<b>Database-monitoring</b> - given the fact that the application shall not have any kind of
            restriction, the "administrator" is an independent service, that will close forms when it's their due date,
            and clean up any information that is no longer valuable.

            <h2>&emsp; Further Development Strategies</h2>
            <p1> &emsp;The project can be further developed by creating a descriptive review of products, such that
                using NLP, the emotion that is felt can be interpreted directly from the fully written review. Other
                special features can be added as well, such as seeing overall ratings for products, in order to create a
                top with the most liked or disliked products. A new type of account can be developed, for "investors",
                who could see the top ratings presented above, in order to find products that are worth sponsoring, with
                more detailed information about the whole market. The admin fearure, not only a service, will also be
                necessary given the increasing number of account types.<br>
                &emsp; Given the project's structure and implementation, the ground for improvement has been already
                prepared, therefore, the source can be further developed, not modified, straightforwardly.
